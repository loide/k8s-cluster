# Kubernetes cluster

A vagrant script to deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements
* Vagrant
* Virtualbox

## How to Deploy
Download the code and execute the following command in the same folder as the Vagrantfile:

```
vagrant up
```

It will create 3 nodes (1 master and 2 workers).

This process will take some time, so go grab a coffee :)
